Description: The NetworkHub package, which we are currently developing, aims to 
  provide users the functionality to retrieve (and cache), process and prepare 
  PPI networks (and their accessory information), in a way that they can be 
  readily incorporated into many downstream operations for transcriptome and 
  proteome data analyses. Moreover, NetworkHub will include functions to 
  efficiently visualize these network data objects, leveraging interactive 
  widgets that can also embed information directly from commonly used containers
  in Bioconductor (e.g. SummarizedExperiment and its derivative classes).
