Description: The NetworkHub package, which we are currently developing, aims to provide users the functionality to retrieve (and cache), process and prepare PPI networks (and their accessory information), in a way that they can be readily incorporated into many downstream operations for transcriptome and proteome data analyses. 
Moreover, NetworkHub will include functions to efficiently visualize these network data objects, leveraging interactive widgets that can also embed information directly from commonly used containers in Bioconductor (e.g. SummarizedExperiment and its derivative classes).
