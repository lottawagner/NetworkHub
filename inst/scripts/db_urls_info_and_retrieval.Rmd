# Retrieving the PPI files from the databases

This notebook serves the purpose of documenting the process of

* identification
* finding relevant information
* retrieving (via construction of URL) 

for the different PPI files that are provided by the databases.

While at it, we will also report some information on the features of interest, with some notes on the latest update provided by each. 
This should assist in the process of spotting out what is changed - in case a bugfix needs to be delivered within NetworkHub.
